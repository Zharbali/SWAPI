## Design and Development Process

The application was designed with a simple and intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily navigate through the different categories of Star Wars data. The development process involved the following steps:

1. **API Integration:** The Star Wars API (SWAPI) was integrated into the application to fetch data about people, planets, starships, and vehicles.

2. **Frontend Development:** The user interface was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Tailwind CSS was used for styling, and JavaScript was used to handle API requests and dynamic content rendering.

3. **Backend Development:** The backend was developed using Flask, a Python web framework. Flask was used to handle routing, API requests, and rendering templates.

4. **Testing:** The application was tested manually to ensure that all features were working correctly and that the user interface was responsive and intuitive.

## Compromises and Known Issues

- **Compromises:** Due to time constraints, some features were simplified, and the design was kept minimalistic.

- **Known Issues:** There are currently no known major issues with the application. However, there may be minor bugs or improvements that can be made in future iterations.
